I decided to build this project in React due to the state management and reusability of the components which 
I took advantage of with the timer counters. This project uses states and props judiciously, as well as the 
React lifecycle hooks to take advantage of when to automatically switch timers, play a gong sound when the 
timer completes, etc.

1- User Story: I can start a 25 minute pomodoro, and the timer will go off once 25 minutes has elapsed.

2- User Story: I can reset the clock for my next pomodoro.

3- User Story: I can customize the length of each pomodoro.
