I decided to build this project in React due to the state management and reusability of the components which 
I took advantage of with the timer counters. This project uses states and props judiciously, as well as the 
React lifecycle hooks to take advantage of when to automatically switch timers, play a gong sound when the 
timer completes, etc.
